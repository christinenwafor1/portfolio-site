            <p>
                I am presently in my third year at Quincy College majoring in computer science with a concentration in cyber security. The field of technology is extremely diverse and I aspire to use the transferable skills acquired in my studies towards my future career in web development. When I began this course my knowledge of web development and coding were extremely minimal. However, I have learned so much valuable information since then as well as gained a level of confidence in the material that I didn't have before !
